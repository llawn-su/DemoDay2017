    "Project Overview: Our project will take the top listened artists from a user’s Spotify account and return concerts and venues where that artist is scheduled to perform. This will save people time and allow them to easily see the artists they love listening to performing live, where they can then purchase concert tickets if they choose to. Our goal is to provide users a new way to preview which shows and events they may want to attend based on their personalized listening history.\n",

    "Outputs: Concert tickets options (price, date, time) and venue information (location, contact information) for top listened artists\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm: \n",
    "1 - Import Spotify API and TicketMaster API\n",
    "2 - User inputs their Spotify account username\n",
    "3 - Create a list of the user’s top 10 listened artists\n",
    "4 - For each artist in the list, find upcoming concerts and venue information\n",
    "5 - Print the above"
